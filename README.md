# SpringUnityMultiplayerExample
This is an example of an authoritative server created using Java Spring. The client is a Unity project scripted in C#.

Here is a great resource that got me started: https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html

# Execution
Run the Java Spring application using Maven to host the server on the default port: localhost:8080.
Open the project in Unity, build the application to create an executable. Run the project in editor and run the build that you created to see the server update the players positions.
